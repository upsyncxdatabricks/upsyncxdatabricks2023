# UpSync x Databricks Collaboration 2023

This is a repo containing work done with the collaboration of Databricks SA team lead by Colin Risler and UpSync Consulting. The project goal was to create a demo to show a state government customer how Databricks can leverage financial historicals to create finanacial historical for an upcoming budget year.

The project work resulted in a cleaned databricks ipython notebook that is prepared for visualization and analysation. The notebook also has some of the UpSync Team's personal visualizations based on the exploration conducted in the cleaning process.

For questions regarding the work/notebook please contact the Project Leaders for this project at either jasondai@berkeley.edu or emilymao@berkeley.edu.
